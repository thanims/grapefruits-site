grapefruits art space is an art gallery based on 1.75 acres of forested land in central vermont. it is run by [martha daghlian ](www.marthadaghlian.com)

grapefruits was recently relocated from portland, oregon. it will host two exhibitions each year: one site-specific show on the land in the warmer months, and one remote show during the winter that engages with the land as a subject or collaborator. please get in touch if you have questions: grapefruitjuiceartists (at) gmail (dot) com

this land is situated within the wabanaki/abenaki nations, or Ckuwaponahkik, "the land of the dawn." growing up here, i was told by adults that there weren't ever any indigenous people in vermont. as i got older, i found out about the original motivations behind this erasure of native history and culture in vermont, which were passed down through generations of european settlers. if you also learned these lies as a young person in vermont, please check out [this generous history shared by the Koasek tribe on their website](https://koasekabenakination.com/our-history/), and get to know this beautiful place a little better!
