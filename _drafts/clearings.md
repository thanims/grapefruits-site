grapefruits art space is proud to announce _clearings_, the first show in our new location on a wooded lot in central vermont. this two-day installation features works on paper and in textiles by kate laster, ním daghlian, and martha daghlian. a clearing in the woods seems to tell you something about where you are, but only in relation to the unknown that surrounds it. what can be learned from deep observation of a tiny fragment of earth? what kinds of signs and messages can help to guide you through an unfamiliar landscape? what does the clearing look like from the woods?

kate laster's cut-paper works respond to crisis and catastrophe with language that offers grounding and space. in _clearings_, her durable, declarative laminated texts merge with the natural environment, allowing light to shine through them and rain to wash over them. in her words, "i make weatherproof papercuts in times of crisis and surrender and determination. my text drifts during constant crisis, processing performative emergency. i trace and alter the roles of stenographers, torch singers, crisis actors & myself, a witness— to put this another way: does the most catastrophic event seem possible to tread or even describe? how can our diasporic nature rest without language to communicate violence under generational trauma, zionism, capitalist agendas and a boiling planet?"

ním daghlian's small scale watercolor paintings depict some of the creatures who share grapefruits art space with us.
